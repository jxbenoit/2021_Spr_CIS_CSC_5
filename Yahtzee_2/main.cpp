    Purpose:Project 1 - Yahtzee FINAL BUILD
    Version:7 lots of corrections, added flags, file, and entire loop of game
 *  Changes: Scoring errors corrected, realized I did not need so many different dice.

    "your score (or zero) will be logged.\nThe game ends when all 13 boxes are filled by all players, "
    "scores are then totaled,\nincluding any bonus points and the player with the highest total wins.\n\n"
            
    "The Thirteen Categories:\n"
    "There are two sections in which to place scores:\nan upper area and a lower area.\n\n"
    "The upper section is aces-sixes (63+ scores a 35 bonus)\n"
    "For example: Total of aces(ones) only, total of twos only, and so on...\n\n"
    "The lower section consists of the following:\n"        
    "3 of a kind = total of all 5 dice\n4 of a kind = total of all 5 dice\n"
    "Full house (3 of a kind and a pair) = 25 points\nSmall straight (any sequence of 4 numbers) = 30 points\n"
    "Large straight (any sequence of 5 numbers) = 40 points\nYahtzee (five of a kind) = 50 points\n"
